# WheelLogAndroid

Updated Gradle configuration to compile with Gradle 4.4, still a few deprecated statements in there

Fixed the Gotway 84V indication issue, the preference change was not processed

Moved the MCM ratio fix for newer MCMs from MainActivity to preference-change processing

Inmotion V8 comms might still be broken, I have no wheel to try it
